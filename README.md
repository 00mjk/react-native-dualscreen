# React Native dual-screen
This repo contains Microsoft's offerings to streamline [dual-screen](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/) cross-platform development using React Native. The modules in the repo will work on any platform, but only Android actually has a dual screen device (Duo).

### Repo status
See below.  We currently have three npm packages for dual screen devices.


## Offerings
This repo provides three modules
* **TwoPaneView** layout component
* **DualScreenInfo** lower-level module
* **TwoPane-Navigation** navigation library for dual screen devices

Please find more details about the features as they were proposed and implemented.  Feel free to chime in with comments about [TwoPaneview](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/197), [DualScreenInfo](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/189) and
