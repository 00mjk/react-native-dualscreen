This repo contains Microsoft's offerings to streamline [dual-screen](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/) cross-platform development using React Native. The modules in the repo are targetting Windows and Adroid.

**Current status**: early stubs / placeholders

This repo will provide two modules
* _TwoPaneView_ layout component
