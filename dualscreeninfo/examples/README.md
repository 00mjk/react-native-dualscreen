## How to run different examples

#### In `App.tsx` you can change which example component will be rendered:
 - `<MasterDetail />`
 - `<CompanionPane />`
 - `<TwoPage />`
 
#### CompanionPane and TwoPage requires specific version of react-native-viewpager, which is not yet released, therefore consumer from custom repo

### Run debug version
```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run run:android
```
